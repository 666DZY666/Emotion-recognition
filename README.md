## What does Emotion Recognition mean?

Emotion recognition is a technique used in software that allows a program to "read" the emotions on a human face using advanced image processing. Companies have been experimenting with combining sophisticated algorithms with image processing techniques that have emerged in the past ten years to understand more about what an image or a video of a person's face tells us about how he/she is feeling and not just that but also showing the probabilities of mixed emotions a face could has.


I have worked with http://pyimg.co/a2soy this dataset, you can download it using the link i have provided, i have provided the pretrained weights of both face detection and emotion detection models 
first run the training file and then the vedio detection file and see it working
